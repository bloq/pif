# Pay It Forward

Pay It Forward is a system self-investment contract.  Funds sent to the
contract are time-locked for a period of time ("frozen"), usually 30-60
days by default.

After a batch of funds "thaws", anyone may withdraw those funds from
this contract to their own account, without restriction.

In Proof-of-Work chains, "anyone" typically means miners, because miners
have first access to anyone-can-spend funds.

Therefore, the likely outcome of this contract is "pay to future miner",
and serves as a useful sinkhole for funds, a way to incentize
continued security of the system.

Another outcome, less likely but possible, is that miners are asleep
at the wheel, and the general public races to claim the funds.

## Current status

The contract and tests are currently under active development (WIP).

Do not use with Real Money.
